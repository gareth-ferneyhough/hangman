# hangman
Microservice implementation of the hangman game using nginx and node.js. A very simple (and rather ugly) front-end is provided. This was a quick homework problem requested by a company I applied to.

## To run:
* Make sure you have node and nginx installed
* In a terminal, run:
  * `cd api`
  * `npm run start`
* In another terminal (in project root directory):
  * `sudo ./start-nginx.sh`
* Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser to play the game
